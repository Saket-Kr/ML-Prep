K-Means is an unsupervised ML algo 
K-means generally uses on Euclidean Distance which computes the root of square difference between co-ordinates of pair of objects.

2.2 Manhattan Distance
Manhattan distance computes the absolute differences
between coordinates of pair of objects
2.3 Chebychev Distance
Chebychev Distance is also known as maximum value
distance and is computed as the absolute magnitude of the
differences between coordinate of a pair of objects.

2.4 Minkowski Distance
Minkowski Distance is the generalized metric distance.
Note that when p=2, the distance becomes the Euclidean
distance. When p=1 it becomes city block distance.
Chebyshev distance is a variant of Minkowski distance where
p=∞ (taking a limit). This distance ca
