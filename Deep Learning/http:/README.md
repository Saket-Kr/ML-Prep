There are two ways of composing models in Keras. They are as follows:
- Sequential composition -  Different predefined models are stacked together in a linear pipeline of layers similar to a stack or a queue.
- Functional composition - Here it is possible to define complex models, such as directed acyclic graphs, models with shared layers, or multi-output models.
