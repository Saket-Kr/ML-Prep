*Data Challenges*
- If the data is arranged in a way that it poses a non-convex optimization problem. It is very difficult to perform optimization using gradient descent. Gradient descent only works for problems which have a well defined convex optimization problem.
- Even when optimizing a convex optimization problem, there may be numerous minimal points. The lowest point is called global minimum, whereas rest of the points are called local minima. Our aim is to go to global minimum while avoiding local minima.
- There is also a saddle point problem. This is a point in the data where the gradient is zero but is not an optimal point. We donâ€™t have a specific way to avoid this point and is still an active area of research.
