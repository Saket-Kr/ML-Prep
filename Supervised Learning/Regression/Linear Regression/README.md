Asymptote - Straight line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance. Sigmoid function becomes asymptote to y=1 for positive values of x and becomes asymptote to y=0 for negative values of x.


Concept of **slope** and **intercept**:  
*Slope*: It indicates the steepness of a line and the intercept indicates the location where it intersects an axis, say y-axis. For example, a company determines that job performance for employees in a production department can be predicted using the regression model y = 130 + 4.3x, where x is the hours of in-house training they receive (from 0 to 20) and y is their score on a job skills test.   
*Intercept*: The value of the y-intercept (130) indicates the average job skill score for an employee with no training. The value of the slope (4.3) indicates that for each hour of training, the job skill score increases, on average, by 4.3 points.
