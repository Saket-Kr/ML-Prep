**SVM** - parameters (epsilon, cost, gamma) 
The points closest to the hyperplane are called as the support vector points and the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane are called the margins. This hyperplane can also be called as *margin maximizing hyperplane*.

**epsilon** - The value of **ϵ** defines a margin of tolerance where no penalty is given to errors. The larger ϵ is, the larger errors you admit in your solution.   
**C** - Inverse of the strength of regularization. As the value of ‘c’ increases the model gets overfits. Control SVM's capacity, under/over-fit.   
**γ** - Gamma (used only for RBF kernel). Behavior: As the value of ‘ γ’ increases the model gets overfits.
