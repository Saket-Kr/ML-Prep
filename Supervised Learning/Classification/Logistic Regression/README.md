Types of logistic regression
- Binary (Pass/Fail)
- Multi (Cats, Dogs, Sheep)
- Ordinal (Low, Medium, High)
It returns the probability that a new sample belongs to one of the two classes according to its location with respect to the line.
limitations of Logistic Regression is the fact that it can only categorize data with two distinct classes.

Sigmoid takes a real value as input and outputs another value between 0 and 1. Itâ€™s non-linear, continuously differentiable, monotonic, and has a fixed output range.

**Coefficient for the slope of the best fitting line** - 
**y-intercept of the best fitting line** - 

Asymptote - Straight line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance. Sigmoid function becomes asymptote to y=1 for positive values of x and becomes asymptote to y=0 for negative values of x.
 
Concept of **slope** and **intercept**:  
*Slope*: It indicates the steepness of a line and the intercept indicates the location where it intersects an axis, say y-axis. For example, a company determines that job performance for employees in a production department can be predicted using the regression model y = 130 + 4.3x, where x is the hours of in-house training they receive (from 0 to 20) and y is their score on a job skills test.   
*Intercept*: The value of the y-intercept (130) indicates the average job skill score for an employee with no training. The value of the slope (4.3) indicates that for each hour of training, the job skill score increases, on average, by 4.3 points.
