Types of logistic regression
- Binary (Pass/Fail)
- Multi (Cats, Dogs, Sheep)
- Ordinal (Low, Medium, High)

Sigmoid takes a real value as input and outputs another value between 0 and 1. Itâ€™s non-linear, continuously differentiable, monotonic, and has a fixed output range.






Asymptote - Straight line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance. Sigmoid function becomes asymptote to y=1 for positive values of x and becomes asymptote to y=0 for negative values of x.
