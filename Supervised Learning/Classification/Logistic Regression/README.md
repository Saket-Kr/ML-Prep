Types of logistic regression
- Binary (Pass/Fail)
- Multi (Cats, Dogs, Sheep)
- Ordinal (Low, Medium, High)
It returns the probability that a new sample belongs to one of the two classes according to its location with respect to the line.
limitations of Logistic Regression is the fact that it can only categorize data with two distinct classes.

Sigmoid takes a real value as input and outputs another value between 0 and 1. Itâ€™s non-linear, continuously differentiable, monotonic, and has a fixed output range.

**Coefficient for the slope of the best fitting line** - 
**y-intercept of the best fitting line** - 




Asymptote - Straight line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance. Sigmoid function becomes asymptote to y=1 for positive values of x and becomes asymptote to y=0 for negative values of x.
